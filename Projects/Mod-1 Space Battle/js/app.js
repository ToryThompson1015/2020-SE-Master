//!You are the captain of the USS Assembly, on a mission to destroy every last alien ship.
//!Battle the aliens as you try to destroy them with your lasers.

//!There are six alien ships
//!Aliens' weakness is that they are too logical and attack one at a time
//!they will wait to see the outcome of a battle before deploying another alien ship.

//!Your strength is that you have the initiative and get to attack first. 
//!However, you do not have targeting lasers and can only attack the aliens in order. 
//!After you have destroyed a ship, you have the option to make a hasty retreat.
//* BEGIN CODING HERE *//

//* A game round would look like this:
//! LOOP
//TODO: Attack the first alien ship, 
//TODO: If the ship survives, it attacks you
//TODO: If you survive, you attack the ship again

//! DESTROYED
//TODO: If you destroy the ship, you have the option to attack the next ship or to retreat
//TODO: If you retreat, the game is over, perhaps leaving the game open for further developments or options.
//TODO: You win the game if you destroy all of the aliens.
//?You lose the game if you are destroyed.

//* SHIP PROPERTIES
//TODO: 'hull' is the same as hitpoints. If hull reaches 0 or less, the ship is destroyed.
    let hull;
    for(hull = 0; hull<=0; hull++){

    }

//TODO: 'firepower' is the amount of damage done to the 'hull' of the target with a successful hit.

//TODO: 'accuracy' is the chance between 0 and 1 that the ship will hit its target.

//! SPACE SHIP BUILD//
//TODO: 'hull' - 20
//TODO: 'firepower' - 5
//TODO: 'accuracy' - .7

//! ALIEN SHIP BUILD
//TODO: 'hull' -  between 3 and 6 
//TODO: 'firepower' - between 2 and 4
//TODO: 'accuracy' -  between .6 and .8
