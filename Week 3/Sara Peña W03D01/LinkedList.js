Advantages

Linked lists are a dynamic data structure, which can grow and shrink, allocating and deallocating memory while the program is running.
Insertion and deletion of node are easily implemented in a linked list at any position.
Disadvantages

They use more memory than arrays because of the memory used by their pointers (next and prev).
Random access is not possible in linked list. We have to access nodes sequentially.
Itâ€™s more complex than array. If a language supports array bound check automatically, Arrays would serve you better.
Note
We have to use free() in C and delete in C++ to free the space used by deleted node, whereas, in Python and Java free space 
is collected automatically by garbage collector.*/
