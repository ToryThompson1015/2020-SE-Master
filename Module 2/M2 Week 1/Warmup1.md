<!-- ! What is a Single-Page Application (SPA)?-->

*   Single page that loads everything at once so you can use it offline without the need to "recall", server requests rendering a new page from the server in the browser

*   webpage just designed from top to bottom no separate pages/ Facebook doesnt open separate pages to interact with it


<!-- ! What is a Multi-Page Application (MPA)?-->

*   webpage with multiple functions/menu/contact us/etc.
-Coffee House has different tabs like menu online shopping contact us etc.

*   Every change eg. display the data or submit data back to server requests rendering a new page from the server in the browser. These applications are large, bigger than SPAs because they need to be. Due to the amount of content, these applications have many levels of UI


<!-- ! When we built our Unit 2 apps, were they a SPA or MPA, why?-->


<!-- ! Give two pros of a SPA -->
*   SPA is fast, as most resources (HTML+CSS+Scripts) are only loaded once throughout the lifespan of application. Only data is transmitted back and forth.

*   Itâ€™s easier to make a mobile application because the developer can reuse the same backend code for web application and native mobile application.

<!-- !Give two cons of a SPA -->
*   It is slow to download because heavy client frameworks are required to be loaded to the client.

*   Memory leak in JavaScript can even cause powerful system to slow down

<!-- ! Give two cons of a MPA-->

*   Changing one thing means you change it on every page or other views
